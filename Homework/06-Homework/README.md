# Analee Guerra's Homework 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

An application used to assist travelers by displaying weather conditions and forecasts for specifically searched cities. This can be used to help travelers plan for weather conditions in various cities they may be traveling to. HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScfript were used to help create the applicaiton and dymnamically update when a city is earched. 

## Installation

A web browser such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox is needed to run the application.

The application can be accessed via the following link: https://aguerra1508.github.io/Homework/06-Homework/index.html

## Usage 

The application page displays the current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast. Unfortunatley, I was unable to adequately get the functionality of the items in storage to return back to the page. Items can be seen in local storage and in the console.
