# Analee Guerra's Homework 04 WebAPI's: Code Quiz

## Description

An application used to help quiz and test knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. This quiz can be used by coding students to help test their knowledge of JavaScript and also see how they compare against their peers. Use of JavaScript and WebAPI's was used to create variables, if/else statements, functions and methods. This exercise provided me with addtional knowledge of JavaScript functionality.
