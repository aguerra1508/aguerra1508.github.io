# Analee Guerra's Homework 05 Third Party API's: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

An application used to assist employess keep track of important events on a daily calendar. This scheduler can be used to help manage time effectively and differentiate between past, present and future events. jQuery was used to help create the template and dymnamically change it according to the time using Moment JS. This exercise provided me with addtional knowledge of JQuery functionality as well as the usage of other API's, adding HTML elements via jQuery.

## Installation

A web browser such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox is needed to run the application.

The application can be accessed via the following link: https://aguerra1508.github.io/Homework/05-Homework/index.html

## Usage 

The application page displays the current days Work Day Schedule. The date is displayed at the top of the screen.  When the user is ready to add an event to the calender, the user will type the event in the colored area of the time slot. The user will then click save in order to save the event to the calendar. As the day progresses, the time slots will change color according to if events have happened in the past (grey), present (red) or future (green). This will help the user see where they are at in the day and hopefully provide better time management.
