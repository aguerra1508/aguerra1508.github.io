# Analee Guerra's Homework 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refractor

## Description

Addition of HTML semantic elements which provided increased accessibility. Code base was improved by making sure links for jumping down the page were functioning, numerous CSS elements were combined and consolidated to "clean up the code" and the CSS document was also organized in a more logical fashion in order to follow the HTML documnent. Comments and description of elements and changes made were also included. 

Gained additional knowledge of semantic elements and their use. Learned more on how to consolidate CSS elements and the advantages of putting comments regarding the changes made. Practiced more with the pulling, adding, commiting and pushing of items to my GitHub repository.
