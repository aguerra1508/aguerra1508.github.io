# Analee Guerra's Homework 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

An application used to generate a random password based on user selected criteria. Randomly generated passwords may provide greater security for sensitive data and information. JavaScript was used to create variables, if/else statements, functions and methods. This exercise provided me with addtional knowledge of JavaScript functionality.

If the user selects a number which is not between 8 and 128, they will be alerted to try again. They will be returned to the Generate Password screen.

Once the user has input a valid number, the user will receive a series of confirms. The user will select if they want to add other character types in their password or not.
